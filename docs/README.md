# Cloud-readiness

## About
The cloud readiness framework provides 
cloud infrastructure provisioning to support test 
environment setup and execution in the following cloud platforms:

* GCP 
* AWS - _coming soon ..._
* Azure - _coming soon ..._


The cloud readiness framework leverages a 
combination of technologies providing the developer with 
flexibility to setup, execute, and teardown cloud-specific tests 
when verifying [K8ssandra](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra).
